I'm Nicolas Ochsner, a creator and problem-solver working at the fascinating intersection of Computer Science and Evolutionary Biology. Holding a PhD in the latter, my academic journey delved deep into the complex systems and adaptive processes that shape life itself. Parallel to this, my passion for the logic, structure, and creative potential of computation led me to become proficient in Computer Science. ",-1),e("p",null," I believe these two fields offer incredibly powerful, complementary lenses through which to view the world. Evolution provides stunning examples of optimization, adaptation, and complex system behavior, while computer science gives us the tools to model, simulate, and build entirely new systems. My work often lives in the space between – exploring how principles from one can inform the other. ",-1),e("p",null," This website serves as my digital portfolio and playground. Here, you'll find a collection of projects that reflect this interdisciplinary approach. Some are technical explorations, others are creative experiments, but all are driven by a curiosity to understand, build, and innovate. You might find my approach a bit unconventional at times – I find inspiration in the elegant (and sometimes messy) solutions found in nature. ",-1),e("p",null," My current focus is channeling this unique perspective and technical skillset towards entrepreneurial ventures. I'm excited by the challenge of building impactful solutions and exploring new technological frontiers. ",-1),e("p",null," Feel free to explore the projects showcased here.
